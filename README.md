# Diffuse_GOALS_emission

The GOALS_dataframe folder contains a notebook that generates a dataframe containing electromagnetic information for each GOALS source (obtained from the SplitIR folder) as well starburst-driven neutrino fluxes obtained via `analytic_neutrino_flux.py`. This dataframe is used in the notebooks `GOALS_flux_predictions.ipynb` & `GOALS_diffuse_predictions.ipynb` to plot per-source and diffuse starburst-driven neutrino flux predictions, respectively.
