# Diffuse_GOALS_emission

GOALS_flux_predictions.ipynb is the main notebook which contains both per-source and diffuse flux predictions. This notebook uses the neutrino fluxes from Dataframe_GOALS.ipynb, which are computed with Analytic_neutrino_flux.ipynb. The diffuse flux predictions are compared to the diffuse flux observed with IceCube. The diffuse IceCube flux is processed with Diffuse_IceCube_nb. 

The neutrino production framework is also used to compute the neutrino flux expected from NGC 1068. This flux prediction is then compared in notebook NGC1068_flux_evidence.ipynb to the recently reported evidence for a neutrino flux from the direction of NGC 1068 by IceCube.
