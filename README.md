# Diffuse_GOALS_emission

The `GOALS_dataframe` folder contains a notebook that constructs a dataframe compiling electromagnetic data for each GOALS source, extracted from the `SplitIR` folder. It also includes starburst-driven neutrino fluxes calculated using `analytic_neutrino_flux.py`. Theoretical motivations and derivations for the analytic neutrino flux can be found in our work: Phys.Rev.D 108 (2023) 2, 023015 ([arXiv:2211.09972](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01020))).
 
The resulting dataframe is utilized in the notebooks GOALS_flux_predictions.ipynb and GOALS_diffuse_predictions.ipynb to generate per-source and diffuse neutrino flux predictions, respectively.

Additionally, the notebook NGC1068_flux_evidence.ipynb compares fluxes obtained via analytic_neutrino_flux.py with the high-energy point-source flux observed by IceCube, as reported in NGC1068_evidence_flux.txt [Science 378 (2022) 6619, 538â€“543].
